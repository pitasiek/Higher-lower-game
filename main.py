# To-Do List
# 1. Display logos and a pre-selected question to start the game.
# 2. Create a list to store available questions/options about famous people/description.
# 3. Implement the game logic:
#    a. Players select option A or B.
#    b. Compare the selected options and determine if the answer is correct or wrong.
#    c. If the answer is correct, increment the player's score and present a new question.
#    d. If the answer is wrong, end the game and display the player's score.
# 4. After finishing the game, provide an option to restart.
